10,wallstreetbets,Let's become banksters,"I have a better idea for what we can do with our profits...

Let's start a bank

https://howtostartanllc.com/business-ideas/bank

It takes between $12-20M in capital to start a bank.

Why don't we start a bank and then we can create money out of thin air and pay off each other's debts?

Think about it.

We can cut out all the useless eater losers from the party and make each of us a debt free baller.

Then we hire our own lobbyists, put our people on the boards of companies, start our own think tanks, etc.

We'll just repeat successful actions and copy what the generationally wealthy do except on a peer-to-peer level.

We just reverse engineer every industry and do it ourselves and cut out the controller freak losers.

If you had no rent/mortgage or car payment, how would that change your life?

Think about it...

Once robotics come online in the near future, many jobs are gone forever and the economy changes forever.

We're either getting Universal Basic Income with slavery strings attached or we steal their idea and do it ourselves.

Our biggest expense is housing, if we all eliminated that monthly bill and put that cash flow towards each other's goals, we are unstoppable.

They couldn't print enough money to stop it.

What does everyone think about this?

Also, please don't make this political or anything else.

Just think from a pure mathematical perspective and a cash flow perspective.

We have the numbers and the power if we stick together.

This is what the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations and all the other ""clubs"" do.

Let's just reverse engineer everything they do and do it peer-to-peer.

If people in here all have businesses we all buy from each other and also help people create their own companies too.

We all are going to use toothbrush, toothpaste, toilet paper, etc as a regular part of our lives, why buy big box brands when we can buy our own stuff?

Keep the money flowing between each other.

I'm sure we have digital marketers in here (I'm one) we can funnel hack Unilever and other companies and if we split our members up via timezones we have 24/7 workforce just taking market share from the big companies and then we can poach their top talent and crowdfund their house (then their salary doesn't matter) and we skull fook these companies into submission.

Think about it...

They can't beat us unless they cheat like Vlad and the hedge funds but then they expose themselves and recruit more people to our team via the Streisand Effect.

Thoughts?

P.S. Here's how I know we're going to win. By playing video games we've been subconsciously programmed to win at all costs. Look at the retired Generals who are involved with Call of Duty if you think I'm joking. They wanted to weaponise us for Open Source Intelligence gathering but we all do this already without them. They opened Pandora's Box and can't close it. They should have just let us play video games ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",0.92,210.0,210.0,qt87lh

13,wallstreetbets,Let's Elect A Board Member,"Alright I've been thinking of a way to personally profit off this but after asking around I'm out of ideas so I'm throwing this out there for fun:

This subreddit has a tonne of stock in a few meme companies in particular, such as GME, Tesla, etc. If you have stock, this means you have the voting rights to elect someone to the board of a company. This means that we have enough stock in total to elect someone to the board of these companies. We can elect a member of this community to become a fully-fledged board member of a large multi-national company. Since I'm an Australian, I think I can only be elected to something like Afterpay's board, but in short, if we chose an American national they can be given a full-time job as a fully-fledged board member of a large publicly listed company such as GME or TSX purely through reddit.

Generally most companies pick insiders to go through the internal AGMs to nominate candidates to become part of the board, however very few people vote in these because they often don't care, since nobody usually cooperates to elect someone to a board. However, with a fully centralized discussion like we have here on r/wallstreetbets, we can elect our chosen candidate to be a member of a board.

Now we just need a process to elect the candidate. I guess suggest your idea for an election process in the comments and we can go for the top-voted, legal one there.

Edit: Alright, it's late at night for me and early in the morning for many of you, I'm going to DM a few of you and then we can get something worked out. I'll then make another post either tomorrow or the day after on this and we can see where we go from there",0.92,722.0,722.0,qsyzkb
14,wallstreetbets,My DD on How Dutch Bros Coffee Will Be Heading to $120,"Hey guys, this will be a DD report compiled of technicals, fundamentals, and random ass sentiment on why I think Dutch Bros (BROS) will grow to become a $20B company within 6 months. 

The first starts with growth from their latest earnings report last week. Dutch Bros earned 23 cents per share. That was above FactSet estimates for six cents per share.

Revenue rose 49.8% to $129.8 million, also above estimates for $125.2 million. Same-store sales gained 7.3%, above expectations for a 5% increase.

Dutch Bros also forecasts next quarter (Q4) revenue of between $125 million and $128 million. That was above Wall Street estimates for $121.4 million. Despite all this growth, little money was spent on advertising. Most came from word of mouth from the younger generation and their parents who drive them. Looking much further ahead, Dutch Bros plans on expanding to 4,000 stores within 10 years - an aggressive 800% increase from today. 

Their decision to grow company operated stores instead of franchise is why I think their revenue growth will continue to grow exponentially. Here‚Äôs an excerpt from the 10-Q:

‚ÄúCompany-operated Shop Revenue
For the three months ended September 30, 2021, company-operated shop revenue grew 62.9% to $108.7 million, as compared
to $66.7 million in the corresponding prior year period or an increase of $42.0 million. Company-operated shops in the comparable shop base contributed $3.0 million to this increase (4.7% same shop sales), while new company-operated shops
opened during 2020 and 2021 contributed $39.0 million to this increase. For purposes of calculating company-operated same
shop revenue growth, company-operated shop revenue for 145 shops was included in the comparable shop base. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, company-operated shop revenue grew 64.7% to $289.5 million, as compared
to $175.8 million in the corresponding prior year period or an increase of $113.8 million. Company-operated shops in the comparable shop base contributed $11.7 million to this increase (8.3% same shop sales), while new company-operated shops
opened during 2020 and 2021 contributed $102.1 million to this increase. For purposes of calculating company-operated same
shop revenue growth, company-operated shop revenue for 120 shops was included in the comparable shop base.‚Äù

Now let‚Äôs transition into the fundamentals. Combining all of the information above with the fact that Starbucks missed on revenue for 3 out of the last 4 quarters tells us in a broader sense that the younger generation is gravitating towards Dutch Bros. It has a much different business model with no inside dining, two separate drive thru windows, outdoor dining that optimizes empty space between the building and drive thru,and you‚Äôre greeted by a ‚Äúbroista‚Äù who approaches your vehicle rather than a speaker. Customer service and promotions have customers coming back, but most come back simply because the coffee tastes better with more variety than competitors. Dutch Bros doesn‚Äôt have to spend money on the overhead of a larger building and their outside dining is popular among kids after school. Their app just launched within the year and already has over 2 million users. Coffee only represents 30% of their sales. This shows us how much variety their menu has, which also includes their Rebel energy drinks and muffins.

The following is kinda random but it fights against the bear case of market cap divided by store count. $10B/500=$20M per store. We know damn well one of these things don‚Äôt cost $20M. Are we paying for a store? Or are we paying for the company that runs it? Starbucks has a ratio of $130B/31200=$4M. So a much more established company that owns 62 times more stores than Dutch Bros is getting a 5 times cheaper price per store‚Ä¶ This leaves us with four options:
1.) Starbucks is 5 times undervalued.
2.) Dutch Bros is 5 times overvalued.
3.) The premium is for future growth potential and with 4,000 stores soon making their way east, the market cap/store count ratio would put the valuation at half of Starbucks. If we considered Starbucks as a base for the ratio which Dutch Bros matched, it would put Dutch Bros at $120 a share 10 years from now. Still a 10% increase YoY. 
4.) Looking at Market Cap is pointless. See Tesla for details.

TLDR: Dutch Bros could become the next Starbucks and they only have 25 million shares in circulation. If you have visited and tasted their coffee before, you know it‚Äôs possible due to next generation‚Äôs preferences and the taste. Very little shares in circulation could send this to $300 if WSB gets behind it. Cramer likes it so maybe we could troll him by making it a meme stock. üòÇ 

Not sure if anyone will actually read this but thanks for your time and let me know if you think my DD is accurate or if there are flaws. Happy investing!",0.82,48.0,48.0,qte5vh

17,wallstreetbets,The forgotten BB,"There are too many DD about BB in the past already about so I don't feel like I need to do a new one. I just want to share some recent updates about BB.

For those who didn't know. You guys should check out the latest 13F-HR filling from Goldman Sachs. It is available on fintel. They are quietly accumulated more shares in the past two months while paid articles kept came out to scare people to sell their shares at cheap price. If it is not good, WHY GS increased their position by more than 300%? and Why there is no articles mentioned about their increased position?

""2021-11-10 - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of 1,789,366 shares of BlackBerry Ltd (US:BB) with total holdings valued at $17,411,000 USD as of 2021-09-30. Goldman Sachs Group Inc had filed a previous 13F-HR on 2021-08-13 disclosing 417,178 shares of BlackBerry Ltd at a value of $5,098,000 USD. This represents a change in shares of 328.92 percent and a change in value of 241.53 percent during the quarter.""

Here is the link on Fintel: [https://fintel.io/so/us/bb/goldman-sachs-group](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb/goldman-sachs-group)

CEO John Cheng is also increased his shares by exercising his options recently. He got 4mil shares and sold **2,222,844** to paid for taxes (according to the taxes bracket, he is supposedly paid 52% for taxes).

One more thing I need to mention is in the last earning call, JC said the patent deal is most likely to be completed before the next earning. Also, their IVY is rumored to be released soon in Jan next years.

So You should do some DD on your own to check this out AND **if you decide to invest in it. Please remember to buy shares and don't buy options because noone know when this will pop**.

PS: I originally have 200c for BB but I decided to changed into all shares now. I still believe it will pop soon tho.",0.81,45.0,45.0,qtd5b8

19,wallstreetbets,BB BlackBerry January launch date imminent üöÄüçá," With the progression of China's EV auto makers continuing to march forward, the FCF of BB will rise in near symmetry. China being the worlds largest and fastest growing economy is a force to be reckoned with. Blackberry's QNX has deep ties with Chinese EV software developers and also has full integration of Baidu maps. This put Blackberry's QNX Neutrino systems in a good position to capture market share of said booming economy. Blackberry has captured design awards with 24 of the top 25 EV makers. This is on top of QNX partnership with Desay to deliver cinematic driving experiences. Desay delivers in areas interior cabin electrification and integration as well as vehicular intelligence, security and connectivity. They offer Smart Solution that encompass 3 areas of Smart Cabin, Smart Drive &amp; Smart Services in some Chinese EV's. üöÄ

On top of this, VW who is also a QNX partner has been increasing sales of it's EV unit in China over the passed couple of months. The ID cars from VW have continued momentous growth in the China market. In October the ID models sold around 13,000 units in one month, surpassing the domestic competitors including NIO, XPeng, and Li Auto who also operate QNX. ""The Volkswagen brand ranked third in October sales of new energy vehicles."" üöÄ

Last but not least the launch estimate of the rocket. This date will be between January 5th to the 8th. BlackBerry has indicated plans to publicly demonstrate IVY at the Consumer Electronics Show CES slated for Jan. 5 to Jan. 8. This IVY system will be the next gen outlook on BlackBerry's future technology with this state of the art platform. Initial partnerships include Amazon AWS, Berkshire Hathaway, Geico and Telus. They have some smaller EV startup partnerships and also albeit they have a slew of developers under NDA. It is said in a post from Oct. 29, BlackBerry reported that it had ‚Äúreleased an Early Access Version of the platform to select ecosystem partners.‚Äù The company also said that , ‚ÄúEarlier this fall, BlackBerry also released a product demonstration of solutions powered by BlackBerry IVY, focusing on electrification use cases. This demo has been shown to several automotive customers and partners.‚ÄùüöÄ

These key driving forces will increase the FCF and the adoption of QNX for automotive platform and security assets. The adoption of the systems is a matter of national security. ""Hackable robots/missiles is what Elon should have mentioned"". The IVY platform will be a revolution for automotive and the apps developed for the QNX will be a revolution for the operating systems kernel adoption.üöÄ

Get in early!üöÄüöÄüöÄ

TL;DR

EV adoption in the world biggest economies is growing momentum.

IVY is about to be demonstrated in less then 2 months.

More QNX applications are being developed at a rapid pace.

24,wallstreetbets,Prepare yourself for AMC movement : TA so simple you could read it in Braille,"[AMC chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/RSutslFQ/)

This is super simple, AMC has been consolidation for months! That means its loading up for a move, this could be up or down but with the news they have been releasing and that other meme stocks are performing well and still covered in the news I'd anticipate this to be a move up and to the right.

This is one of the simplest and easiest patterns to identify so it likely has a LOT of eyes watching it, which can be a very good thing. Most often, these kind of patterns do not run all the way to the apex. So I'd anticipate that a move starts in 2 weeks or less, although there is closer to 4 weeks until the apex of the pattern is reached.

I've included some targets for the weak on the chart so if the price sees a little slowing in those areas you know it's because the poor need to take profits to cover their rent. For those that like the stock, the actual measured move is also shown. If the price starts to move north you will see AMC flood the media and WSB posts, which will easily make it ape into the moon targets.

Not financial advice, but it is advice I'd give for those attempting to do financially oriented things in a manner such that you enlist some dollars to recruit additional dollars for your wallet.",0.67,122.0,122.0,qt2pjc
