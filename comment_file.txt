Will NVDA justify it's incredible run or will WSB lose a bit more people each earning season?

Find out next week!

Potential plays I'll probably do:

* Calendar call spread on NVDA
* Sell way OTM calls on LCID shares
* Sell way OTM weeklies against BABA leaps
* Calendar call spread or debit call spread on TGT

The tickers that might make surprise big moves scoring sick gains from irresponsible weeklies:

* KSS
* WDAY
* BILI

Only Q is which direction. I say puts on KSS as they might guide pretty terrible and is always on the verge of getting fucked...pthis is the score

As someone in the mid 7-figure club myself, I can tell all of you that the first million is, indeed, the hardest. It's not a trite saying, at all. Once you have that, it becomes incredibly easy to put that money to work snowballing out of control to create the next 1,3,5 million in the recent economy. Though I do expect a big correction coming. This dude, if he does it right, should have life set now on Easy mode if he didn't already. Disclaimer: I bought a bunch of TSLA in October 2016, rode the split, and set my stop-loss at 850 and it liquidated on me. I made a ton, and have lost out on a ton of further upside, but I ain't cryin'.this is the score
